#I2C_EEPROM library

The original library had a bug in the page write function. Fixed here https://github.com/douggilliland/lb-Arduino-Code/commit/372eb734cb66c95d27627cbe4ab93c315346d850.

##Ownership

Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others. There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there". Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same. Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

##Warning

Use at your own risk. If you brick your part or it melts to a puddle, it's on you not me.

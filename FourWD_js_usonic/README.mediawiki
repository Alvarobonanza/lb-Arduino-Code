=== Hardware ===
*  Four Wheel Drive (4WD) car by DFRobot (I think at least. I got it at Makershed.)
* Arduino UNO
* [File:http://www.makershed.com/product_p/mkad7.htm Motor Shield]
* 2-Axis Joystick. I am using the Parallax part sold by Radio Shack.
* Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04. I got mine for cheap from China (about 3.50 USD).

=== Operation ===
* Joystick has 7 positions, forward left, forward, forward right, back left, back, back right and stop. To stop let the joystick return to center.
* Ultrasonic sensor should stop the robot within 12 inches of the obstacle.

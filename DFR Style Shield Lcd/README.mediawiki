[[File:http://myarduino.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/51076045/lcd-key-1620r640-2wpins.JPG]]

* The DFRobot style shield can be distinguished from other LCD shields by the misspelling of RIGTH.

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of them were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
